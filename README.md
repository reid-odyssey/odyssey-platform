# Odyssey Console

A comprehensive multi-tenant console frontend for Odyssey's spatial computing services, built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Login Page**: Modern authentication interface with social login options (GitHub, Google) and email/password
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Project-based access control with role-based permissions

### 🏗️ Project Management
- **Project Overview**: Firebase-style dashboard with real-time metrics and activity feeds
- **Project Settings**: Configuration management, API keys, webhooks, and danger zone
- **Users & Permissions**: Team member management with role-based access (Owner, Admin, Developer, Viewer)
- **Billing & Usage**: Comprehensive billing dashboard with usage analytics and payment management

### 🚀 Product Services
The console provides dedicated interfaces for all 7 Odyssey services:

1. **Asset Manager**: 3D asset, texture, and media file management with CDN integration
2. **Content Delivery**: Global CDN management with edge location monitoring
3. **Spatial Comms**: Real-time communication for spatial experiences
4. **Avatar**: Avatar creation and management system
5. **Configurator**: Visual configuration tools for 3D products
6. **Spatial UI**: UI components for spatial applications
7. **Hosting**: Application deployment and hosting with custom domains

### 🎨 Design System
- **Custom shadcn Registry**: Reusable Odyssey-specific components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI patterns
- **Consistent Branding**: Odyssey logo and color scheme throughout

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.18.0 or higher
- **npm**: Latest version

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Run the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open your browser**:
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Environment Variables

For authentication to work in production, set:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (recommended, e.g. `https://app.2x22.com`)

`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is used for deterministic auth callback redirects and avoids host/origin mismatches behind proxies/CDNs.
